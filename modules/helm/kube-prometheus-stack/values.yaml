    ## EnforcedTargetLimit defines a global limit on the number of scraped targets. This overrides any TargetLimit set
    ## per ServiceMonitor or/and PodMonitor. It is meant to be used by admins to enforce the TargetLimit to keep the overall
    ## number of targets under the desired limit. Note that if TargetLimit is lower, that value will be taken instead, except
    ## if either value is zero, in which case the non-zero value will be used. If both values are zero, no limit is enforced.

    ## Per-scrape limit on number of labels that will be accepted for a sample. If more than this number of labels are present

    enforcedLabelLimit: false

    ## Per-scrape limit on length of labels name that will be accepted for a sample. If a label name is longer than this number
